		<p>Here is a definition for the scones:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scone">
		A scone is a baked good, usually made of either wheat or oatmeal with baking powder as a <br>
		leavening agent, and baked on sheet pans. A scone is often slightly sweetened and occasionally<br>
		glazed with egg wash.[1] The scone is a basic component of the cream tea. It differs from teacakes<br>
		and other types of sweets that are made with yeast. Scones were chosen as the Republic of Ireland<br>
		representative for Caf√© Europe during the Austrian Presidency of the European Union in 2006,<br>
		while the United Kingdom chose shortbread.<br>
